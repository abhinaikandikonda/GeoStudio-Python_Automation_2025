Instructions for Running the Automated Python Script:

Update File Paths:
Before running the script on a different PC, update all relevant file paths:

1.Set the correct path for GeoCmd.exe.
2.Update the path where the Excel file (containing material property values) is located.
3.Ensure output directories such as xmlfiles are correctly defined.

Excel File Configuration:
The script reads material properties directly from the Excel file. Ensure that:

1.The Excel file is located at the specified path.
2.The data format and structure in the Excel file remain consistent.

Access XML Model File Generation:

1.The XML model file must be generated first before the simulation begins.
2.This model defines the geometry and structure of the system.
3.The script uses this XML template and continuously updates it with material properties read from the Excel file for each iteration.

Mesh File Requirement:
1.Before executing the script, ensure that the required mesh file is present in the xmlfiles directory. The simulation cannot run without this mesh.

Output Directory Setup:

1.Ensure the xmlfiles folder is created inside the output directory.
2.This folder will store all the intermediate XML files used in the simulation.

Output Generation:
Once the script is run, it will:

1.Continuously generate multiple XML input files, each updated with different sets of material properties from the Excel file.
2.Execute these XML files to run simulations using GeoCmd.exe.
3.Automatically generate and save the corresponding output results in Excel format within the specified output directory.
